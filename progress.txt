Struggling to find a nice (fast) way to back search the text. Ultimately I would like to explore speed ups using bloom filters and boyer-moore search, but for now I'm going to start with a brute force search. Currently things are complicated because of:
  * ring buffer
  * search greediness
  * how to handle partially full buffer

I have a working prototype (with bugs). Very naive implementation. Notable lacking features:
  * variable length pattern match
  * better (faster) search algo
  * cleaner ring buffer. Need a simple way to index from head and tail of the buffer.
  * Better string management. Current method is based on c strings (but worse) and is very fragile.
